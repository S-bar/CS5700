Milestone April 7, 2014
=======================
High-Level Approach
1. DNS Server
Look up the format for a DNS A record query, then implement code that parses it and get the domain name that clients request. Follow the format for a DNS answer and build a DNS packet, then returns a well-formed response with a specific IP address.

2. HTTP Server
We customize our HTTP server based on python built-in HTTPServer class.


Challenges
The most challenging part in this milestone is parse a DNS request and send a DNS answer with a correct IP address. We solve this problem by reading this document: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amislove/teaching/cs4700/fall09/handouts/project1-primer.pdf and  understanding DNS format.
